# Tutorial
## Prerequisites
1. [ghdl](https://ghdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) must be installed at the moment since it's only a simulation and not synthesis.
## Building
```bash 
cd scripts
./build.sh
```
This also does the testing!

## Testing
```bash 
cd scripts
./build.sh
```

## Docoumentation
The documenation provided is in the form of latex. There is a makefile provided, however as I'm doing this on a mac I found it easier to open the `main.tex` file in TexShop as all the package paths resolve and _just work_.

## To Do
* Import to Vivado and synthesise
* Put on a board
* Write the documentation to support this
